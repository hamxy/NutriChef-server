Notes of what I did so far:

- default express app with "npm express-generator"

- auth REST route
    POST signup - creates a new user
    POST login - login existing user
    GET signup and login is not needed, as React.js will have them and it will send POST request to API

- auth controllers are in separate files to keep code clean

- User schema contains mongo error handling / validation:
    email: uses validator to check if email is valid email
    password: min length 6 characters (default mongo validation)

- auth controller error handling: 
    - email errors: 
        * email already exists - check if err.code is 11000
        * string is not valid email
    - password errors:
        * password contains less than 6 characters
